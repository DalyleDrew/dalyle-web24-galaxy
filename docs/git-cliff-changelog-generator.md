# `git-cliff` Usage

## Examples

### Initial Version
Generate initial CHANGELOG based on:

1. Having some recent dev commits that you want in `v1.2` but you don't have a `v1.1` yet.
2. `v0.0.0` tag pointing to the repo's first commit.
3. `v1.2.0` tag pointing to the `PROD` commit, or whichever commit it should be.


```shell
git cliff -o CHANGELOG.md v0.0.0..v1.1.2

# (optional) Commit CHANGELOG
# todo: #helpme Might be wrong scope/emoji for Conventional Commits
# Modify however you like.
git add CHANGELOG.md cliff.toml
git commit -m "build(DevEx): ðŸ”Š Add CHANGELOG.md generated by git-cliff"
```

#### todo: Alternate Way with `--tag` ?
For some reason I couldn't get this to work. My fault for sure, just don't understand it yet.

```shell
git cliff --tag 1.1.2
```

### Bump Version

```shell
git cliff --bump -o CHANGELOG.md
```
