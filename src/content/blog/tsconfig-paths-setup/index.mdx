TSConfig path aliases are a powerful tool that can help you to improve the readability, maintainability, and error-proofing of your TypeScript code. This allows for easier to read clean code, and enables us to move files around without having to update import paths in every file.

*This is a huge time saver.*

## What Are Path Aliases?

The goal is to replace the following import statements:

```ts
// relative import path
import MyComponent from "../../../components/MyComponent";
```

with these import statements:

```ts
// alias import path
import MyComponent from "@components/MyComponent";
```

We can do this with a `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file. We will be using TypeScript in this post.

## How To Setup Path Aliases

### Adding Path Aliases To Your TSConfig File

We need to update our `tsconfig.json` file to enable aliases. We will add a `paths` and `baseUrl` property to the `compilerOptions` object. Each path is relative to the `baseUrl`.

This will tell TypeScript to replace the alias with the actual path when compiling the code.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".", // root of your "paths" below. Required if "paths" is defined
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"] // enables us to use @components/MyComponent
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Path Aliases In Your Code

Now in all of your source files, you can import components like this:

```ts
// Without path aliases
import Hero from "../../../components/Hero";
import Footer from "../../../components/Footer";

// With path aliases
import Hero from "@components/Hero";
import Footer from "@components/Footer";
```

  although you may have to create the file `tsconfig.json`. Consult your
  framework's documentation for more information.

## Why Should I Do This?

Let's say we have the following file structure:

```
.
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── Hero.tsx
    │   └── Footer.tsx
    └── pages/
        ├── index.tsx
        └── solutions.tsx
```

### Annoying Relative Imports

If we want to import `Hero.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` into `index.tsx` and `solutions.tsx`, we would need the following import statements:

```ts
import Hero from "../components/Hero";
import Footer from "../components/Footer";
```

### Refactoring Relative Imports

Now lets say we want to refactor. We now have multiple "solutions" and want to have each on their own page, and have them under a `solutions` directory. The file structure now looks like:

```
.
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── Hero.tsx
    │   └── Footer.tsx
    └── pages/
        ├── index.tsx
        └── solutions/
            ├── solution.tsx
            └── solution2.tsx
```

Now we have to update the import paths of `solution.tsx`:

```ts
import Hero from "../../components/Hero";
import Footer from "../../components/Footer";
```

You can see how this makes refactoring more of a chore. We have to update the import paths in every file that imports these components. This is a huge time sink and can lead to bugs if you forget to update the import paths.

### Alias Imports Version

Alternatively, if from the start we were using aliases, we would not have to update any files using the components. This is far better for maintainability:

```ts
import Hero from "@components/Hero";
import Footer from "@components/Footer";
```

  With this method, *every* file that needs to import these components will
  import them the same way. This makes it easier to move files around without
  having to update import paths.

## Additional Paths

This can be extended to any number of path aliases. Some other potential ones you might use:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@config/*": ["src/data/*"],
      "@js/*": ["src/js/*"],
      "@layouts/*": ["src/layouts/*"],
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@assets/*": ["src/assets/*"]
    }
  }
}
```
