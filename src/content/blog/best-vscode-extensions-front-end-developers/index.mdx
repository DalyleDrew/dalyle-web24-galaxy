This extension is great for teams that want to enforce consistency, or just to keep you from having to worry about formatting your code.

With over **34 million** installations, you could say it is popular.

### ESLint

[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) is a configurable linter to help you find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. It can be used for both frontend and backend development, and is a great way to catch bugs before they happen. It can check for mistakes like unused variables, missing semicolons, and more.

[GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) is an AI-powered pair programmer that helps you write better code, faster. While this is a paid tool (currently $10/month), it can be a huge time saver for developers.

### Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) is an extension that provides intelligent autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting for Tailwind CSS.

If you are using Tailwind CSS, you will 100% want this extension.

### Auto Rename Tag

[Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) is a fairly simple extension, but a big time saver. If you change the opening of an HTML tag, it will automatically update the closing tag. This ensures your tags always match.

### Color Highlight

[Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight) is a simple extension that will highlight colors in your code. This is great for quickly seeing what color a variable is set to, or if you are using the correct color in your CSS.

### Auto Close Tag

[Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag) is another simple extension that can save you time. It will automatically close HTML tags for you. So when you type `<div>`, it will automatically add the `</div>` to match.

### CSS Peek

[CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek) is a great extension for frontend developers. It allows you to quickly see the CSS for a given HTML element. This is great for when you are trying to figure out why a certain element is styled a certain way.

### Live Server

[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is a VSCode extension that allows you to run a local server with live reload. This is great when initially learning web development with basic HTML, CSS, and JS files, as it will update your preview in real time!

<Admonition variant="tip">
  If you are using a framework, odds are this extension is unecessary. Your
  framework will have a similar feature built in for live reloading.

### ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets

[ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) is a collection of snippets for React, Redux, and React Native. If you write React code, you will want this extension.

### Better Comments

[Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) improves the comments for your code. It provides syntax highlighting for different types of comments, like the below picture shows.

### Material Icon Theme

[Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) provides icons for files and folders in VSCode. This makes it easier to find what you are looking for, and makes your code window look nicer.

### Dracula Official

[Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) is a dark theme for VSCode. It is one of the most popular themes on the marketplace, and my personal favorite theme.

If you don't like this particular theme, you should pick a different theme to install in VSCode, as they can provide additional syntax highlighting support.

### Pretty TypeScript Errors

[Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors) provides a more readable error message, and provides a link to the documentation for the error. I have fallen in love with this extension for TypeScript development.

## Bonus Extensions

These are a few other extensions I find useful, but didn't quite make the top tier list.

### Astro

[Astro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) is an obvious extension if you are developing using Astro. It provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and more.

  Astro is my meta framework of choice for SSG and SSR, which allows you to use
  whatever UI framework you want within it (React, Vue, Solid, etc). I highly
  recommend it.

### CodeTour

[CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) allows you to record and playback guided tours of codebases, directly within the editor. This is great for onboarding new developers, or just for documenting your codebase.
