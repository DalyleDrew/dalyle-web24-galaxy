~~Circa~~ _(pretentious word in my head, yours too?)_;

## 2024Q1-Q2 I Discover [Astro](https://astro.build/)

*...or, [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) discovers me?!*

<Admonition variant="info">
  *This is NOT about the [dog from the Jetsons](https://thejetsons.fandom.com/wiki/Astro), but
  the AMAZING "framework?", "Static Site Generator (SSG)', ... that is known as `Astro`.*
</Admonition>

<Admonition variant="caution">
  I am BEGINNER with Astro. To be honest with you, I still don't actually know
  what it does. But what I do know, is working in the FE is a piece of cake! I
  am a BE developer by trade, but far more full-stack and full-full-stack than
  most.

### ‚úîÔ∏è I ~~Needed~~ Wanted

1. Online Identity Homepage (Portfolio? Linktree?)

2. Template for a business I want to work with

3. Template for my business

4. Template for [fatner.org](https://www.fatner.org/), my teenage son and my new <br /> **"Organization to Help Fat Fathers Connect with their Teenage Children"**
    1. *If you take the "their" out of that mission statement, it sounds super duper creepy.*

5. Template for something else?

# I See [Galaxy](https://cosmicthemes.com/themes/galaxy/)

I saw a [super pretty theme `("Galaxy")`](https://cosmicthemes.com/themes/galaxy/) and decided it was a bargain to buy [the very cooly named author's ](about:blank) **All Access** One-Time Purchase plan.

**I have been ever so impressed since! This dev knows what he is doing!**
