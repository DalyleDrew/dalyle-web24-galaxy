Watch me watch (and critique) a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BliLxgPhlTg\&utm_source=dalyle.ca\&utm_medium=blog\&utm_campaign=2024-04-04-voice-meeter-potato-basics-low-latency-asio-device-setup) with AMAZING KNOWLEDGE but that I found a little slow for my squirrelly, fast-paced, racing mind.

Once I got to the end of the video, Garrett discloses that he spoke slowly and with more "spacing" than usual to help people understand the information better, which makes sense, but still too slow for me ðŸ˜‰.

I've wanted to see if I could do a better video than someone on the same topic.

I also wanted to test [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/referrals/9AIKFLQV) Speach-to-Text and using [VM Potato](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm?utm_source=dalyle.ca\&utm_medium=blog\&utm_campaign=2024-04-04-voice-meeter-potato-basics-low-latency-asio-device-setup) to pipe audio from a specific source, in this case the YouTube Video, into Otter for translating, separate from my physical mics or other background operating system= sounds.

But really, I was just looking for something to do while enjoying my new **basement office setup** (post coming soon!).
